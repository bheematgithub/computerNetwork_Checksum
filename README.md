# Checksum Calculator

This checksum calculator is a simple Python script that computes the checksum for a set of binary frames. It helps in detecting errors in data transmission by comparing the checksum calculated at the sender's side and the receiver's side.


## Key Points

- **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
  - The script displays each step of the addition process, making it easy for learners.
  - Final checksum are printed out, showing the detailed calculation.

- **Error Detection:**
  - The script checks if the received frames match the sent frames by calculating and comparing checksums.
  - It provides a clear indication of whether an error was detected in the transmission.

## Sample Output

Here is an example of the output generated by the script:

```python
<<<<<<<<<<<<< Check sum calculator >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


********* Enter sender frames *********

Enter no. of frames:2
Enter frame1: 1001
Enter frame2: 1010
  1001
+ 1010
-----------
  10011

  0011
+    1
-----------
  0100

SENDER CHECKSUM is: 1011

********* Enter receiver frames details(assuming all frames are received) *********

Enter frame1: 1001
Enter frame2: 1010
  1001
+ 1010
-----------
  10011

  0011
+    1
-----------
  0100

Final checksum calculation:
  1011
+ 0100
-----------
  1111

RECEIVER CHECKSUM is: 0000
->No error detected
```
