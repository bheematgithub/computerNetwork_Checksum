Checksum error detection is a technique used to detect errors in data transmission or storage by calculating and verifying a checksum value. The checksum is a simple mathematical operation performed on the data, and the result is appended to the data before transmission or storage. Upon receiving the data, the receiver recalculates the checksum and compares it to the transmitted checksum to check for errors.
